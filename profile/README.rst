This project explores the feasibility and performance of a Cherenkov plenoscope to observe cosmic gamma rays with energies as low as one giga electron Volt in collecting areas as large as several thousand square metres.

Organization
************
This github organization collects the ideas, drafts and compter programs which estimate the performance of the Cherenkov plenoscope to observe cosmic gamma rays.
The computer simulations are split into small and mostly independent packages. Mostly the computer simulations are written in ``python``, ``C``, ``C++`` and ``Fortran77``.

The ``starter_kit`` repository is special. It collects all the other packages as submodules and is the place where the computer simulations for the Cherenkov plenoscope are developed.
